## This is AutoGroundMacro!

AutoGroundMacro is an addon designed to enhance your gameplay by automatically generating @cursor macros for spells that require target location selection, all based on the description of the ability. Whether you're changing talents or just need a quick setup, AutoGroundMacro ensures you always have the @cursor macros that you need.

## What are the slash commands my good sir?

- `/agm help`: List all available commands.
- `/agm clear`: Delete all AGM macros.
- `/agm reset`: Delete and recreate all AGM macros.
- `/agm run`: Manually trigger the macro creation process.
